The name of the company is First National Battery. For the last 87 years the company has progressed significantly. The type of battery manufactured in this company is lead acid batteries. These types of batteries are used in several applications. Usage is by mining, surface traction, forklifts, vehicles, lights and renewable energy applications.</p>",,,<p>Batteries that are wet or flooded (FLA) require the periodic addition of electrolytes. For decades this has been the traditional technology for starter and leisure batteries. Making them readily available globally for different leisure uses. When using these batteries in modern environments they will traditionally only give you 70-80& of their rated capacity.</p>,,,"<p>On an annual basis, more than 2 billion spent batteries are discarded at U.S. solid waste plants. This accounts for more than half of the cadmium (54%) and nearly all of the mercury (88%) which ends up in solid waste depositories in the United States. It's a worrisome and short-sighted practice which endangers both groundwater and drinking water resources, a concern which will exist for decades to come. As a result, the safeguards put in place to monitor battery disposal have a duty to encourage fewer discards to begin with, as well as more responsible recycling efforts and safer waste management all around.</p>",balding cure,"Find cures for baldness (other than hair replacement, hair transplants, or wigs).",CTRN: Change That's Right Now | Phalacrophobia,http://www.changethatsrightnow.com/phalacrophobia/,"<p>A Permanent Solution to Phalacrophobia.
